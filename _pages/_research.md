### Overview
As a researcher in high-energy particle physics, I am mainly involved in the analysis of data provided by the ALICE experiment.
The ALICE experiment is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with special focus on heavy-ion collisions.
While the LHC normally provides collisions of two protons (pp collisions), a fraction of each years datataking is dedicated to the collision of heavy-ions such as lead (Pb-Pb collisions), as well as asymemetric collisions of protons and lead ions (p-Pb collisions).
This data offers especially interesting physics insights inaccessible with mere pp collision, that either arise due to so-called cold nuclear matter effects or the formation of a new state of matter: The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).
I am particularly interested in the following research questions, which are connected to my various research projects given in this section:
- How does the substructure of a proton change when part of a bigger structure, e.g. a lead nucleus?
- What are the probability distributions of very soft (low momentum) gluons inside the proton? Can we probe the onset of non-linear Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), i.e. gluon saturation?
- How do outgoing quarks of a hard scattering process fragment into heavy neutral mesons such as omega mesons? Is our theoretical description of their production accurate?
- Quantification of transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). How does the QGP modify the production of various observables such as jets?

Over the years I became increasingly more interested in tackling these questions using electromagnetic probes, especially photons, as they are a particularly
