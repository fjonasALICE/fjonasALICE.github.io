I was very honored to give the ALICE overview talk at the [161th LHCC meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1509225/contributions/6350763/attachments/3024174/5336835/LHCCALICEStatus_final.pdf), where I also had the chance to present my recent measurements of [omega meson production](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2848263) and [prompt photon production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18054). I am grateful for the opportunity and the interesting discussions following the talk.
